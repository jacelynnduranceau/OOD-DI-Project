OOD Project

Team Composition:
    Swanora Campbell, Joseph Frost, Jacelynn Duranceau, Marc Colin

Project Backstory:
    This project will allow users to encounter random Pokemon. We plan on the XML
    file to specify the region of Pokemon you want to encounter Pokemon in
    (similar to selecting the kind of Pizza you want from the class example). 
    Your choice will determine what kind of Pokemon have the chance to spawn upon
    running the project. The act of spawning a random Pokemon will be performed
    by dependency injection. The user will have the option to try to catch the
    Pokemon they encounter, and if successful that Pokemon will persist within
    the database.
