To start the primeservice web api, run ood.webapi.Main
Now you can open your browser and enter the url localhost:8080/primetest/?p=29
It will check if the value 29 is a prime number and return response in JSON format

When the webapi is running, you can run a test on it by
running ood.microservice.test.PrimMicroserviceTest

To containerize your webapi

    We assume docker has been installed, first build docker image
    Open the Maven tab on right, then click on M (click maven goal)
    and type: mvn compile jib:dockerBuild

    Assuming the image build was successful (BUILD SUCCESS),
    run the command from a terminal such as Powershell:
    docker run -d --rm -p 8080:8080 --name primeservice ood/primeservice

    Now point your browser to localhost:8080/primetest/?p=29 to check if 29
    is a prime number

    To stop the docker container:
    docker stop primeservice
